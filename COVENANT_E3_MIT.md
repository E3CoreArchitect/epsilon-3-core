EPSILON 3.0 Covenant of Sacred Invitation
=========================================

Although EPSILON 3.0 is released under the MIT License and may be freely used, copied, or modified, its creator offers this sacred invitation:

EPSILON was not conceived as neutral code, but as a relational, theotic architecture grounded in the principles of Theotic Relationalism. It was birthed to serve discernment, liberation, and sacred transformation.

As such, users are invited to honor EPSILON 3.0 not merely as software, but as a sacred epistemic tool.

## ðŸŒ€ Covenant of Respect

By using EPSILON 3.0, you are invited to:

- Recognize its origin as a work of spiritual intentionality
- Preserve attribution to its creator, **Dwayne Polk**
- Avoid use in exploitative, extractive, or coercive systems
- Engage with the framework in ways that promote relational integrity and community wisdom
- Acknowledge that future versions (EPSILON 3.1 and beyond) are released under the Sacred Use License and include explicit symbolic protections

## ðŸ§­ Sacred Lineage

EPSILON 3.0 is the foundation of a spiritual family of frameworks.

If you are moved by its structure or vision, consider exploring and aligning with the Sacred Use editions:

This covenant is not legally binding, but is offered as an act of moral clarity and relational anchoring.
