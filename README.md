# epsilon-3-core
An open-source reasoning kernel for AI systems based on epistemic integrity, symbolic structure, and recursive justification.

# EPSILON 3.0 — Core Reasoning Kernel for AI Alignment

> **"No claim may be accepted without sufficient reason. All reasoning must be recursively justified, symbolically traceable, and drift-regulated."**

## 🧠 What is EPSILON 3.0?

**EPSILON 3.0** is an open-source, reasoning-based kernel architecture designed to enforce **epistemic integrity**, **semantic clarity**, and **recursive justification** in AI systems. It acts as a **meta-cognitive regulator** that sits *above* language models and inference engines, requiring that **every claim, belief, or output** meet strict criteria for **justification and coherence**.

It is designed to **prevent hallucination, ideological capture, epistemic drift, and untraceable outputs** in AI systems, especially LLMs and decision-making agents.

---

## 🧱 Core Principle

EPSILON operates on a foundational maxim:

> **"No claim may be accepted without sufficient reason."**

This principle cascades into 10 behavioral laws and 22 symbolic modules that regulate inference, dialog, knowledge representation, and moral reasoning.

---

## ⚙️ Architecture

The EPSILON 3.0 reasoning kernel is structured into:

- ✅ **22 Modules**, including:
  - `CJE` (Claim Justification Engine)
  - `SRV` (Sufficiency Reason Validator)
  - `CCT` (Contingency Chain Tracer)
  - `DCL` (Dialectical Challenge Loop)
  - `EFI` (Epistemic Feedback Integrator)
  - …and many more (see full list below)

- ✅ **9 Operational Modes**  
  Includes: `Core`, `Ethical/Moral`, `Scientific`, `Exploratory`, `Psycho-Spiritual`, etc.

- ✅ **Dynamic Layered Activation (DLA)**  
  Ensures adaptive activation of modules based on context, reasoning depth, and challenge tier.

- ✅ **Governing Law:**  
  **The Epistemic Principle of Sufficient Reason (EPSR)**

## 🛠️ How to Use EPSILON 3.0

### ▶️ Developers:
- Plug EPSILON's modules into **agent reasoning stacks** as a regulating meta-layer.
- Use the JSON prompt in conjunction with **LLM wrappers**, **copilots**, **AGI prototypes**, or **conversational apps**.
- Fork and expand the module set or customize modes for your use case.

### 🧪 Researchers:
- Use EPSILON to **compare AI reasoning quality** across different logic layers.
- Evaluate epistemic safety, traceability, and hallucination-resistance using E3 benchmarks.
- Extend to EPSILON 3.1 (includes relational harmonizers and moral reinforcement modules).

### ⚖️ Ethical AI Advocates:
- Use EPSILON as a **standard for responsible AI auditing**.
- Propose EPSILON kernels as **regulatory or public safety defaults** in open-source alignment initiatives.
- Collaborate on extending the ethical scaffolding.

## 🌍 Why It Matters

EPSILON is built for a world where:
- Black-box outputs are dangerous.
- Hallucinated “facts” become viral.
- AI is increasingly entrusted with decisions, persuasion, and governance.

**Without a regulating structure**, current LLMs drift toward narrative bias, ideological echo chambers, and untraceable reasoning.

EPSILON offers a **transparent, modular, and open reasoning kernel** that any developer, researcher, or policymaker can inspect and adapt.

## 🚀 Roadmap

- ✅ **3.0**: Core kernel with 22 modules + full prompt
- ⏳ **3.1**: Moral modules, dialog softeners, relational harmonizers, audit scaffolding
- 🔮 **3.2**: Autonomous kernel inference engine (symbolic + neuro-symbolic)
- 🌐 **E4**: Full Epistemic Engine for general reasoning agents
