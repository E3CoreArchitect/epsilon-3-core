# EPSILON 3.0 Core

An open-source reasoning kernel for AI systems based on **epistemic integrity**, **symbolic structure**, and **recursive justification**.

## 🔍 What is EPSILON 3.0?

EPSILON 3.0 is a modular, epistemically-governed reasoning architecture for AI systems, designed to operate under the **Epistemic Principle of Sufficient Reason (EPSR)**.

It enables:
- Claim-by-claim justification (no hallucination)
- Symbolic reasoning structures
- Recursive self-regulation and drift prevention
- Context-aware logic module activation
- Embedded ethical prioritization and user alignment

## 📄 White Paper

We’ve included both human- and machine-readable versions of the EPSILON 3.0 white paper:

- [📄 Markdown version](./EPSILON3-WhitePaper.md)
- [📎 PDF version (print-ready)](./EPSILON3-WhitePaper.pdf)

This paper covers the full architecture, module breakdowns, behavior rules, and how to integrate EPSILON into AI governance and alignment frameworks.
